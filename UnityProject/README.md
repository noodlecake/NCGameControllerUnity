# NCGameControllerUnity - UnityProject
This is the Unity Project used to do quick tests of the plugin and to generate the .unityplugin file.

Note that the Unity editor only re-loads DLLs at launch, so you need to restart Unity any time you make a change to the mac bundle.

Also note that the iOS and tvOS static libraries are built for those systems and will only work on-device.
